# arduino-usb-terminal
 Terminal like app to send commands to Arduino through USB
 
 This app simplifies testing your Arduino components that work with direct usb commands by giving you the ability to send custom commands and view the returned message from your Arduino device.
 
 This is being done as a hobby, and for experimenting, so probably there might be some flaws; As an example, the vendor ID of Arduino is hardcoded to only work with Arduino devices, but this is my use case and please feel free to change it to match your needs.
 
 ### Knows Issues
 On Android 5.1.1, the Arduino serial output cannot be shown. (It is said that an Android internal bug is the issue!)
 
 Suggestions and PRs are welcome! :)
